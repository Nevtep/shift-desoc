# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

### Monorepo Impact Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **MR-001**: Feature spec MUST identify impact across contracts, indexer,
  Manager app, tests, and documentation.
- **MR-002**: If contract interfaces or event schemas change, spec MUST define
  compatibility expectations and migration/versioning requirements for the
  indexer and downstream dApps.
- **MR-003**: Spec MUST state how derived/indexed state maps back to canonical
  on-chain state and events without introducing shadow authority.
- **MR-004**: Spec MUST define role/authority implications for privileged flows
  and confirm Governor/Timelock governance path expectations.
- **MR-005**: Manager UI requirements MUST map to actual implemented contract
  capabilities and MUST NOT rely on aspirational protocol behavior.

### Compatibility And Migration Requirements *(mandatory when applicable)*

- **CM-001**: Breaking changes MUST be explicitly marked and justified.
- **CM-002**: Required migration/replay/backfill steps MUST be defined for
  indexer and app consumers.
- **CM-003**: Event and ABI change impact on downstream niche dApps MUST be
  documented.

### Documentation And Terminology Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **DT-001**: `neuromancer/SHIFT_SYSTEM.md` and `contracts/FEATURES.md` MUST be
  updated when shipped behavior changes.
- **DT-002**: Specs MUST use current Shift terminology (Engagements,
  ValuableActionSBT, VPS, PositionManager, RevenueRouter, RequestHub, Drafts,
  Governor/Timelock, Target ROI).
- **DT-003**: If implementation status, drift risks, backlog priorities,
  architecture expectations, or workflow requirements change, specs MUST include
  synchronized update requirements for
  `.github/project-management/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and
  `.github/project-management/STATUS_REVIEW.md`.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
- **SC-005**: [Cross-layer consistency metric, e.g., "0 unresolved
  contract/indexer/app drift items at merge"]
- **SC-006**: [Compatibility metric, e.g., "All required migration/replay steps
  validated in staging"]
